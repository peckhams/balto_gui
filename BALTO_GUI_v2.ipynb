    "This Jupyter notebook creates a GUI (graphical user interface) for the BALTO (Brokered Alignment of Long-Tail Observations) project.  BALTO is funded by the NSF EarthCube program.  The GUI aims to provide a simplified and customizable method for users to access data sets of interest on servers that support the OpenDAP data access protocol.  This interactive GUI runs within the Jupyter notebook and uses the Python packages: <b>ipywidgets</b> (for widget controls), <b>ipyleaflet</b> (for interactive maps) and <b>pydap</b> (an OpenDAP client).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python source code to create the GUI and to process events is in a Python module called <b>balto_gui.py</b> that must be copied into the same directory as this Jupyter notebook.  A Python module to create plots and color images from data, called <b>balto_plot.py</b>, is included as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This GUI can be toggled between an <b>accordion style</b> and a <b>tab style</b>.  Both styles allow you to switch between GUI panels without scrolling in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this notebook in a browser window without installing anything on your computer, using something called <b>Binder</b>.  On GitHub, on the README page, you will see a Binder icon and a link labeled \"Launch Binder\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this Jupyter notebook without Binder, it is recommended to install Python 3.7 from an Anaconda distribution and to then create a <b>conda environment</b> called <b>balto</b>.  Instructions for how to create a conda environment are given in Appendix 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This GUI makes it much easier to browse, download and analyze data from servers that support the OpenDAP protocol.  Under the hood (in balto_gui.py), it performs many calculations automatically, by making use of any metadata that is available for a chosen dataset. Keep in mind, however, that this is a work in progress that will continue to be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default <b>OpenDAP URL Dir</b> in the GUI is a test server with a wide variety of datasets for testing common, unusual and edge cases."
